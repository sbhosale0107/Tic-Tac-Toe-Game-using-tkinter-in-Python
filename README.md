This code creates a simple GUI using tkinter with a 3x3 grid of buttons. The buttons are stored in a 2D list for easy access. The 'click_button' method handles the logic for when a button is clicked - it updates the button's text to the current player's symbol, updates the game board, checks for a win or tie, and switches the current player. The 'check_win' method checks for a win by checking each row, column, and diagonal. The 'check_tie' method checks for a tie by checking if there are any empty squares left on the board. The 'restart' method resets the game board and clears the button texts.
